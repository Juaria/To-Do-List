A simple to do list created using javascript.

features:

• It shows the current local date.

• The user can add their to-do's in the "add-to-do" space by hitting "Enter" in the keyboard after writing it.

• The user can check mark after the to-do is done.

• The user can delete their to-do's.

• The user can refresh the whole list.


It has few issues such as, if the users to-do is a paragraph, and another to-do is added after that, it gets added on top of the previous to-do. probably because the fixed space for the lists in the container.
But as long as the list is short and within the max-width of 880px as per the design, it works just fine.
Still working on fixing the issue for better use.
